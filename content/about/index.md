I am a Cloud Engineer at [Reply](https://www.reply.com/cluster-reply/en/), in Milan (IT). 
As a cloud engineer at Cluster Reply, the reply company focused on implementing solutions based 
on Microsoft Azure, I work with my team to build scalable and secure cloud, multi cloud and hybrid 
infrastructures for our customers. Within my team, I’m particularly focused on designing and implementing 
infrastructures based on Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters, using the DevOps approach enabled 
by IaC (ARM, Terraform) and  the paradigm of serverless development. 

I completed my Master's degree in 2020 at Politecnico di Milano. My research thesis was supervised by Prof. Sergio M. 
Savaresi and covered a practical implementation of Augmented Reality in the automotive field using Head Mounted Displays. 
I'm currently enrolled in the 2nd level Master specialization in AI & Cloud at Politecnico di Torino.

## Education
{{< book title="2nd level Master's degree, Artificial Intelligence & Cloud" authors="Politecnico di Torino, Jan 2021 - Present" image="images/polito.png" size="300x" >}}
The Master’s Programme illustrates how to concretely use modern digital technologies, from effective data management to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques, all through the most recent implementation models on the Cloud.
The cloud specialisation explores the main components that characterise IaaS and PaaS solutions on the four main cloud service providers (Azure, Aws, GCP and Oracle Cloud). Throughout the deep dive on CSPs, particular emphasis is laid on the Devops approach and Infrastructure as Code, microservice-based architectures using containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift) and serverless development.
