## Education
{{< book title="2nd level Master's degree, Artificial Intelligence & Cloud" authors="Politecnico di Torino, Jan 2021 - Present" image="images/polito.png" size="300x" >}}
During my second-level Master's degree studies at PoliTO, I gained a comprehensive understanding of modern digital technologies and how to apply them in practical scenarios. My program covered the main components of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions on Azure, AWS, GCP, and Oracle Cloud, as well as the DevOps approach and Infrastructure as Code. I also gained hands-on experience with microservice-based architectures using containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift) and serverless development.
