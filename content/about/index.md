I am a Cloud Engineer at [Reply](https://www.reply.com/cluster-reply/en/), in Milan (IT) working mainly on Microsoft technologies.
I completed my Master's degree in 2020 at Politecnico di Milano. My research thesis was supervised by Prof. Sergio M. 
Savaresi and covered a practical implementation of Augmented Reality in the automotive field using Head Mounted Displays. 
I'm currently enrolled in the 2nd level Master specialization in AI & Cloud at Politecnico di Torino.
