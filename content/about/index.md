I am a CLoud Engineer at Reply, in Milan (IT) working mainly on Microsoft technologies.
I completed my Master's degree in 2020 at Politecnico di Milano. My research thesis was supervised by Prof. Sergio M. 
Savaresi and covered a practical implementation of Mixed Reality in the automotive field using Head Mounted Displays. 
I'm currently enrolled in the 2nd level Master specialization in AI & Cloud at Politecnico di Torino.
